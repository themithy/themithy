# Code of Conduct

I will refrain from professionally engaging in the creation of programs or
other services related to: usury, gambling, speculation, or any fraudulent
activity including cryptocurrency and the so called climate change agenda.

The term: 'usury' means an act of charging interest on loans including credit
and mortgage; 'gambling' means an act of putting money at stake to win higher
return; 'speculation' means an act of purchase solely at the expectation that
the property will increase in price, which includes to some degree: shares,
bonds, and other similar vehicles; 

The term 'cryptocurrency' means some sort of computer algorithm that was
designed to represent currency.  Although the ethical nature of it is not
entirely clear, I dub it as speculation unless it is a legal tender. 
 
The term 'climate change agenda' means a collection of policies centered upon
an unparalleled assumption that the emission of certain gases is extremely
harmful to the environment. Beside the fact that those policies cannot be
justified on ethical, moral, economical, political and social ground, there
exist also enough evidence to presume it is a fraud on scientific ground.
